# Handsome Scheduler

This project uses Rails, React, Handsontable, and Google's Calendar API to bulk add calendar events as opposed to simply one at a time.

The end goal of this application is to provide a baseline of event transfer to a Google Calendar (title, start date, end date) and have the rest post to a handsontable spreadsheet so that it can be quickly bulk edited/updated as needed. Users can have as many additional custom columns as they want to keep track of whatever data they might need. This is a passion project of mine, arising out of the need for something like this in my previous position at American Councils. Coordinating hundreds of events in a year is challenging by itself. Excel is something that all professionals are familiar with, and having a tool to manage these events in a simple, yet familiar way is something that is desperately needed. It makes for easy transfer of existing data stored in spreadsheets as well, since all a user needs to do is format it locally in Excel and copy/paste in to the handsontable spreadsheet.
